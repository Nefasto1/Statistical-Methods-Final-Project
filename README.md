## Statistical methods project

 - Type of file: __slides__ and __report__

### Structure
 - Explain every variable
 - Analysis of variable behaviors pre transforamtion and motivate variable transformation (factors etc...)
 - Analyisis of variable behaviors post transformation and hypothesis on correlation
 - Selection of pred variables (for best_price) (check on R^2 and see if it is worth it to keep all variables)
 - Work with some models (lin reg, poisson etc...) and analysis (resid etc...)
 - Try some glms for pred

# Abstract
# Introduction
 - Write what this report is about & objective
# Preprocessing
 - Spiegare cos'Ã¨ ogni variabile
## Data cleaning
 - Rimuovere la colonna index, drop model name
 - Handle duplicated rows (same model, what do we do? if same stats but pop just merge and take the mean of the pop)
 - Correct any inconsistencies or errors in the data
## Data transformation
 - Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (factors) suitable for analysis: capire come gestire popularity (binning & trasformazione in fattori)
 - Feature scaling: Scale numerical features to a similar range to prevent bias in certain algorithms (e.g., normalization or standardization). Normalization? Log? Motivate choice (memory log_2). On timestamp need ideas (go find something)
 - Feature engineering: Create new features from existing ones that might enhance the performance of the model.
 - Dimensionality reduction: Reduce the number of features while retaining important information (e.g., using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection methods). __Forse non serve__
# Data analysis
 - First data analysis (graphs + cor matrix)
 - Analyze + motivate dropping some vars (highest, lowest & outlier)
